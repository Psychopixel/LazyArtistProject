Let's start with a surreal landscape inspired by the works of Salvador Dali and Giorgio de Chirico. I want you to create an image of a vast desert filled with giant melting clocks and eerie, empty buildings. The landscape should be bathed in a warm, golden light, casting deep shadows across the surreal landscape. The buildings should appear ancient and mysterious, with long shadows stretching out across the sand. The clocks should be distorted and twisted, melting into the sand or stretching out unnaturally. Make sure to use bright colors for the sky and sand, but keep the buildings and clocks in muted shades to emphasize their eerie nature.
